* Administration - current thoughts are to have a multi-section or multi-page registration process to set up the administration structure:
```
    * Registration including confirmation email
    * Role: Athletic Director, Coach, Scorer.
    * School and Team types.
    * Different levels of account confirmation dependent on role.
    * Will require a table of top officials for sign-offs (probably AD's).
    * Will be editable after registration.
```
* Objects:
```
    - Registration including confirmation email
    - User/Scorer
    - School
    - Team
    - Player
    - Match
    - Game
    - Roll
```
